# gen_coverage

`gen_coverage` is a simple command line application you can use to:

1.  Generate [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) reports for your
    dart packages.

1.  Enforce a minimum coverage percentage using the `--min-coverage` argument

If you are using Flutter, you do not need to install this, since you can use the
command `flutter test --coverage`.

## Installation

To install `gen_coverage`, just add it to your dev_dependencies in the
pubspec.yaml

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  gen_coverage: ^0.0.1
```

## Usage

Once you have added `gen_coverage` to your pubspec and ran `dart pub get`, you
can run the command `dart run gen_coverage` in the root of your project to
generate the report in `./coverage/lcov.info`.  
You can optionally specify the `--min-coverage` argument to make the command
fail if your overall code coverage is below the specified value.  
Using the `--help` flag will show all the options the command supports.
